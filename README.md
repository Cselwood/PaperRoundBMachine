> B-Method newspaper delivery system!

Using B-Method and Formal Specification, this delivery route system is programmed to be safety-critical, and defect-free using the B-Method on AtelierB and animated in ProB software. The program details names of different available newspapers and magazines in the United Kingdom, and houses on the road that require each item. It ensures the program is bug-free by using B-Method and stating explicitly the relationships between newspapers, magazines and houses that want (or don't) those items. This program was originally designed by me at University.

## Features

    - Has a wide array of reading items available
    - Ensures each house only gets delivered what it has ordered
    - Is guaranteed to be bug free by being developed in an abstract machine

## How It's Made!

    - Entirely in B-Method
    - Using set theory, and relationships
    - Designed as a standlone abstract machine!

## Installation

Clone the file and upload to your own ProB software, alternatively any software which can edit B (such as AtelierB) can be used to edit and improve the code.
